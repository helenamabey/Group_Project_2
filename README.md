# Group_Project_2

Submission guidelines:

Form a group of 3-4. Every group member submits the same executive summary report (within 2 pages) and appendix (with no limit on pages) with detailed analysis, python code and/or excel files, the presentation PowerPoints, about 10 mins recorded presentation for the upper management(provide the youtube link), AI statement and the peer evaluation form.

Sample grading rules:

+Very nice python coding

+Nice EDA analysis

+Well written executive report.

+Nice presentation

+Introduced new independent variables.

+Introduced seasonality in the model.

+Used lagged data in independent variables.

+checked assumptions of linear regression

+perform cross-validation

+Fairly high adjusted R^2 with high model accuracy

+ In-depth analytical recommendations

+Advanced time series models, etc.

 

- for not checking the assumptions of multiple linear regression

- not sufficient EDA

- multiple regression R2 is not big enough

- shortage of prediction part

- Report writing can be improved.

- The presentation can be improved.

- weak python coding

-Lagged data was not used in independent variables.

-Seasonal independent variables were not used correctly

-didnâ€™t drop those independent variables which are not significant

-not fixing violations of assumptions of MLR

-shortage of cross-validation
